**📈 Financial Market Analysis & Algorithmic Trading with Machine Learning**

In this project, I applied data science and machine learning techniques to analyze financial markets using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, with a focus on NVIDIA (NVDA) and selected S&P 500 companies. I completed this project as part of a tutorial developed by the Northeast Big Data Hub and the National Data Science Corps.

In summary, I:

- Collected, cleaned, and processed historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze price trends, returns, volatility, and correlations
- Engineered features using technical indicators, including moving averages

**🧠 Trading Strategies & Modeling**

I implemented algorithmic trading strategies, including:

Moving Average Crossover

Mean Reversion

Backtested each strategy and evaluated performance across different market conditions

Built and evaluated machine learning models to forecast stock returns

Assessed model performance using multiple evaluation metrics and visualized predictions versus actual returns


**📊 Portfolio & Financial Analysis**

Applied portfolio optimization techniques to analyze risk–return tradeoffs

Implemented core financial models such as:

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

Efficient Frontier

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Yahoo Finance API

**📈 Takeaway**

This project strengthened my ability to apply machine learning, quantitative finance, and data visualization to real-world financial data, and demonstrated how data-driven methods can inform trading decisions and portfolio construction.
